# Guidelines for **Hacktoberfest 2021**

## Rules for Participants

* Pull/merge requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.

* The pull/merge request must contain commits you made yourself.

* If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

* If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

* To get a prize, you must make four approved pull/merge requests (PRs/MRs) on opted-in projects between October 1st and 31st in any time zone.

* This year, the first 50,000 participants can earn a prize: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest T-shirt.
